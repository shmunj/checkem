# Checkem

Web app that lets you check 4chan threads for post IDs ending with repeating digits.

It can be used with a simple interface:
```
https://<checkem server address>

or directly

https://<checkem server address>/check/<board>/<thread id>
```

Or as an API:
```
https://<checkem server address>/data/<board>/<thread id>
```
